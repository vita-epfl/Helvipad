## Abstract

Despite considerable progress in stereo depth estimation, omnidirectional imaging remains underexplored,
mainly due to the lack of appropriate data.
We introduce <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Helvipad</span>,
a real-world dataset for omnidirectional stereo depth estimation, consisting of 40K frames from video sequences
across diverse environments, including crowded indoor and outdoor scenes with diverse lighting conditions.
Collected using two 360Â° cameras in a top-bottom setup and a LiDAR sensor, the dataset includes accurate
depth and disparity labels by projecting 3D point clouds onto equirectangular images. Additionally, we
provide an augmented training set with a significantly increased label density by using depth completion.
We benchmark leading stereo depth estimation models for both standard and omnidirectional images.
The results show that while recent stereo methods perform decently, a significant challenge persists in accurately
estimating depth in omnidirectional imaging. To address this, we introduce necessary adaptations to stereo models,
achieving improved performance.

## Benchmark

We evaluate the performance of multiple state-of-the-art and popular stereo matching methods, both for standard and 360Â° images. All models are trained on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with
the largest possible batch size to ensure comparable use of computational resources.
